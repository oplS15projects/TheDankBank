Be brief. A simple list and example is sufficient. \r\n* **Object Oriented Programming** was used to implement the bank account class which holds user info and account balance, and provides ways of withdrawing and depositing money.\r\n* Password ciphertext is computed using ascii characters stored in **recursive data structures**\r\n\r\n##External Technology and Libraries\r\n* We used the racket **GUI library** to create the GUI for the application.\r\n* A **SQL database** is used to store each user's info persistently\r\n* **Ascii character encoding** manipulation was used for password processing\r\n\r\n##Favorite Lines of Code\r\n####Matt (a team member)\r\nMy favorite lines of code are the Vigenere cipher text generating function. The keylist defined generates a keylist from the keyword which matches the length of the password. The function body uses `map` and `foldr` to apply the vigenere cipher to concisely apply the vigenere cipher with the keylist to the password, and convert the resulting cipher text back to a string.\r\n```scheme\r\n(define (vigenere-cipher password keyword method)\r\n  (define (folder-proc a b result)\r\n    (cons (shift a b method) result))\r\n  (define keylist (gen-v-key (string-length password) keyword))\r\n  (list->string (map chr (foldr folder-proc '() (map ord (string->list password)) keylist))))\r\n```\r\n####Tyler \r\n\r\nFavorite line of code was naming the main window \"dank memes since 1993.\"\r\n\r\n####Mike\r\n\r\nFavorite line of code was when we print \"you dropped your lambdas!\" on overflow\r\n\r\n#How to Download and Run\r\n[Download v.02 release here](https://github.com/oplS15projects/TheDankBank/tree/v0.2)\r\n\r\nclone the repo, open BankClient.rkt in Dr. Racket and run.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
